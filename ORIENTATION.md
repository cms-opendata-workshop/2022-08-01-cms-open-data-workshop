## Welcome

Welcome to the third workshop on the use of open data from the CMS experiment. We are really happy to have you here!

Please do not forget to subscribe to our [mattermost team](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodws2022/channels/town-square), where dedicated discussion channels will be created to assist you during pre-exercises and workshop lessons.  In order to do so, and if you do not have CERN credentials, please obtain a [lightweight CERN account](https://account.cern.ch/account/Externals/) (unless you have done so already to register).

## Pre-exercises

In order to make the best use of the time during the event, we have prepared a set of pre-exercises, which you are requested to go through before the workshop.
This is because we know that setting up the proper environment may take some time, and it may happen that you would need help.
We can help you get started before the workshop, but during the workshop we really want to concentrate on the use of open data.  We will do our best in order to have all technicalities settled down in advance.

Please note that all pre-exercises <strong style="color: red;">require you to submit some very simple work assignments</strong>.  This can be done using our [assignment form](https://forms.gle/7YYRv6ZCTfRYiocr7); you must sign in and <strong style="color: red;">click on the submit button</strong> in order to save your work.  You can come back to edit the form at any time.

Please add yourself to the pre-exercises Mattermost channels if you need assistance and/or are willing to help out or contribute to the discussion:

* [Cloud pre-exercise channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodws2022/channels/cloud-pre-exercise)


## Workshop strategy

During the workshop you will be introduced to examples on how to access physical objects, like electrons, muons and jets, and their properties.  For this, a basic understanding of `ROOT` and `CMSSW` is needed.  Legacy releases of these frameworks are most efficiently preserved using containers, like `Docker`.  You will also learn about triggers and how to determine the luminosity for an analysis, which will complete the basics about extracting the needed information from our open data.  After this a brief analysis example, using pre-processed Run 1 data, will be presented.

At the heart of this workshop, we will attempt to run a simplified, but quite thorough, physics analysis.  We will do this using pre-processed Run 2 data. Then, you will have the opportunity to learn about cloud computing and why its usage is advantageous for performing analysis with open data.  Finally, an alternative way of doing analysis, with ADL (Analysis Description Language), will be presented.
