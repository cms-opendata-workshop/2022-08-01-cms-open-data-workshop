  Since 2014, the CMS Collaboration has pioneered the release of LHC research quality data for public
  use by making a significant amount of these data accessible through the CERN Open Data portal.  
  At the end of 2021, the CMS Collaboration released the first batch of its Run 2 data.
  This workshop is a third of a series that started in 2020 and it aims to bridge the 
  technical gap that usually exists between the scientific creativity of an external 
  analyst and the nuts-and-bolts details of a full analysis with CMS open data.
  All exercises will be hands-on and participants should be prepared to dive into 
  the data right away. A set of pre-exercises and assignments are provided and 
  required for participants so that they can make the most of the workshop.
  Time will also be spent brainstorming with attendees about how the entire 
  process of accessing and analyzing the data could be made more useful for the broader HEP community.
